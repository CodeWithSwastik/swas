# The Swas programming language
This is a language that was made for fun.

# Installation
You can clone this repo or download it as a zip and then run swas.py

# Running 
```bash
python swas.py [filename]
```
The filename is optional, if no filename is provided it will run the shell.

# Getting Started

## Hello World
```
upload "Hello, World!"
```

## Variables
Variables are containers for storing data.

### Creating Variables
Swas has no command for declaring a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

```
x => 5
y => "Mark"
```

### Using Variables
To use the variables, simply reference them

```
upload x
upload y
```

### Case Sensitive 
Note: Variables names are case sensitive i.e. `a => 5` is not the same as `A => 5`
